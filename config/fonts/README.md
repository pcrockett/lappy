# Font Config

**fonts.conf**: Allows me to use a font alias in my Alacritty config. This way,
when my chosen font is missing some glyphs (like emoji), it'll fall back to another
font that has those glyphs. Thanks to <https://blog.sebastian-daschner.com/entries/linux-terminal-font-alacritty-jetbrains-mono-emoji>.
